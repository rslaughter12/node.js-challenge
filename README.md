# README File Generator 

## Description

This project is designed to automatically create a user's README.md file for them based on the information that they have provided in their terminal. Their answers are then populated into a proper readme format as well as providing default answers if the user has not been able to provide any information for a quesiton. The README.md file for this project was created in my terminal.
